# Drone Arena

Drone Arena is a Java-based simulation project developed as part of a university coursework focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and JavaFX. The project simulates a space-themed drone arena where different types of drones interact within a graphical user interface.

## Features

- **Interactive GUI:** The user interface displays a window representing the arena where drones operate. Users can start, pause, and reset the simulation using intuitive controls.
- **Diverse Drone Types:** Users can add four different types of drones to the arena:
  - **UFO Drone:** Moves randomly and bounces around the arena.
  - **Star Drone:** Acts as a stable obstacle that other drones bounce off.
  - **Asteroid Drone:** Destroys UFOs in its path.
  - **Planet Drone:** Spawns UFOs and teleports upon collision.
- **Control Panel:** Includes buttons for adding each type of drone and sliders to adjust the simulation speed.
- **Drone Management:** Features buttons for removing specific types of drones or all drones at once.
- **Information Display:** Shows details such as drone ID, coordinates (X, Y), angle, speed, and radius.
- **File Management:** Allows users to save the simulation state, load previous states, and exit the application.
- **Help and Information:** Contains tabs for 'File' and 'About', where 'About' provides details about the application.
